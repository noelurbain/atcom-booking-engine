Version: 0.2.1 (milestone 2: catalog)

New in 0.2.1:
- The 23 Cancún zones come preloaded by name (as on resortstours.com), with the Cancun Hotel Zone and
  Playa Mujeres shapes copied over. Pick a zone, then draw or adjust its shape. "Add a zone" for new ones.

New in 0.2.0:
- Control panel at /control (our team only): Zones and hotels, Providers.
- Zones and hotels: Google map, draw and reshape zones, add hotels from Google search or a pasted list
  (up to 25 at a time); each hotel goes into the zone that contains it, or can be placed by hand.
- Providers: details, commission, payout method, vehicle categories and zones served at CUN, vehicles.
- Status page checks the Google Maps keys and can test the Server key.

Milestone 1 (0.1.0):
- Creates the engine's 21 database tables (prefix atc_): providers and affiliates, airports, zones, hotels,
  vehicle categories, vehicles, drivers, services, prices, extras, bookings, trip legs, ledger, payouts,
  coupons, tickets and the audit log. Money is stored in cents.
- Adds Cancun Airport (CUN) and the six vehicle categories.
- Adds the roles: Booking staff, Transport provider, Affiliate, Travel agent.
- Adds Booking Engine > Status and Booking Engine > Settings in wp-admin (commission 25%, affiliate 8%,
  referral 2%, payout day 10, auto-complete 24 h, service code 4 characters / 5 tries).
- REST API: /wp-json/atc/v1/ping (public) and /wp-json/atc/v1/status (staff only).

Nothing is shown to travelers yet. Deactivating keeps all data.

Stripe secret keys go in wp-config.php, never in the database:
define( 'ATC_STRIPE_TEST_SECRET', 'sk_test_...' );
define( 'ATC_STRIPE_TEST_WEBHOOK_SECRET', 'whsec_...' );

Google Maps keys also go in wp-config.php:
define( 'ATC_MAPS_BROWSER_KEY', '...' );
define( 'ATC_MAPS_SERVER_KEY', '...' );

Tests: php tests/money-test.php && php tests/geo-test.php
